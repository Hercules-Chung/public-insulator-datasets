# Unifying Public Datasets for Insulator Detection and Fault Classification in Electrical Power Lines

Data of the merged two public isolator detasets available with the code to merge then.

## Data
If you just want to use the data generated by this work, download the images and labels available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1829TgSKUVGZXk4_cd1BKtK0L9XHkHA4j?usp=sharing).

## Installation
All code was tested using Python 3.7

We use the Albumentations API to perform data augmentation.  
The API is available [here](https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations). Use the Albumentation instruction to install then.

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To do the merge and increase the data of this work, it is necessary to download the dataset proposed by Tomaszewlki et al. available here and copy the content to the Tomaszeski folder. Do the same for the CPLID dataset available here and copying its contents to the CPLID folder.

Copy the contents of the albumentations folder to the folder where the Albumentations project was cloned.

## Usage

Change the "data_root" file path from data_augmentation.py file to the path that you cloned this project and run with Python in Albumentation project folder:


```python
python data_augmentation.py
```
